    "# Generate Knowledge Prompting\n",
    "Generated Knowledge Prompting is a technique in prompt engineering where the model first generates relevant background knowledge about a query before attempting to answer it. This approach enhances the model's ability to reason and provide accurate responses by explicitly prompting it to recall or infer useful context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying solely on its pre-trained knowledge, the model is first asked to generate foundational information related to the task. This generated knowledge is then incorporated into a second prompt to improve the quality and depth of the final response.\n",
